# ANALYSIS OF PICK FREQUENCY

## NBA (Average 12-15 games per night)

### Games That Would Get Picks:

**STRONG PICKS (Both V5 + V6 agree) - 10-15% of games:**
- Championship contender vs lottery team (e.g., Celtics vs Hornets)
- Major injury advantage (star player out + B2B situation)
- Sharp money + model consensus (line movement confirms ML models)
- Example: Warriors vs Spurs (when both algorithms see value)

**GOOD PICKS (V6 only, high conviction) - 5-10% of games:**
- Clear mismatch but no line movement signal
- Strong rest advantage + ELO gap (models agree but line hasn't moved)
- Injury-driven value that models detect early
- Example: Bucks vs Pistons (Bucks rested, Pistons on B2B)

**NO PICKS (Declined) - 75-80% of games:**
- Close matchups (ELO difference < 100 points)
- Both teams healthy and rested (no edge)
- Public betting games (Lakers, Warriors) - efficient markets
- Model disagreement (probabilities vary too much)

### Daily Pick Estimate:
- **NBA (12 games/night):** 1-3 picks per day
- **Peak days (Saturday):** 3-5 picks from 15+ games

## NFL (Average 13-16 games per week)

**STRONG PICKS - 20-25% of games:**
- NFL has more variance (injuries matter more)
- QB injury = automatic strong signal
- Rest advantage (Thursday vs Sunday teams)
- Weather impact (cold/wind for passing teams)

**GOOD PICKS - 10-15% of games:**
- Divisional mismatches
- Strong defense vs weak offense
- Home field in playoffs

**NO PICKS - 60-65% of games:**
- Playoff games (too efficient)
- Prime time matchups (sharp money already in)
- Close spreads (-3 or less)

### Weekly Pick Estimate:
- **NFL (16 games/week):** 4-6 picks per week

## NHL (Average 8-12 games per night)

**STRONG PICKS - 12-18% of games:**
- Goalie advantage (starter vs backup)
- B2B situations (fatigue factor huge in hockey)
- Home ice + rest advantage

**GOOD PICKS - 5-8% of games:**
- Strong possession team vs weak defense
- Streak teams (5+ wins/losses)

**NO PICKS - 75-80% of games:**
- Evenly matched teams
- Unpredictable sport (puck luck factor)

### Daily Pick Estimate:
- **NHL (10 games/night):** 1-2 picks per day

## Soccer (EPL - Average 5-10 games per week)

**STRONG PICKS - 15-20% of games:**
- Top 4 vs bottom 3 teams
- Home advantage + form
- Injury to key striker/keeper

**GOOD PICKS - 5-10% of games:**
- Momentum plays (team on winning streak)
- Desperate situation (relegation battle)

**NO PICKS - 70-75% of games:**
- Mid-table matchups
- Too much variance

### Weekly Pick Estimate:
- **Soccer (8 games/week):** 1-2 picks per week

## OVERALL ESTIMATES

### Per Sport Daily Average:
- NBA: 1-3 picks/day (from 12 games)
- NHL: 1-2 picks/day (from 10 games)
- NFL: ~1 pick/week (from 16 games per week)
- Soccer: ~0.3 picks/day (from 8 games per week)

### Combined Total:
- **Daily Average: 3-6 picks across all sports**
- **Weekly Average: 20-35 picks total**
- **Monthly Average: 85-150 picks**

### Pick Rate by Confidence Level:
- **75%+ confidence (Strong consensus):** 30% of picks
- **65-75% confidence (V6 + V5 agree):** 40% of picks
- **60-65% confidence (V6 only):** 30% of picks

### Success Rate Expectations:
- **Strong picks (75%+):** 65-70% win rate expected
- **Good picks (65-75%):** 58-62% win rate expected
- **Decent picks (60-65%):** 54-57% win rate expected
- **Overall target:** 60%+ win rate across all picks

## FACTORS THAT INCREASE PICK FREQUENCY

**1. Injury News** (Morning of game)
- Star player ruled out → Creates value
- Backup goalie starting → Strong signal
- QB injury → Immediate pick

**2. Line Movement** (Day of game)
- 2+ point move → Sharp money detected
- Reverse line movement → Contrarian value
- Steam move → All books moving together

**3. Schedule Situations**
- Back-to-backs (NBA, NHL)
- 3 games in 4 nights
- Cross-country travel + B2B
- Short rest (NFL Thursday games)

**4. Mismatches**
- Top team vs tanking team
- Playoff team vs eliminated team
- Hot streak (5+ wins) vs cold streak (5+ losses)

**5. Home Court/Ice/Field Advantage**
- Strong home record + opponent weak on road
- Altitude advantage (Denver)
- Weather advantage (cold weather teams in snow)

## FACTORS THAT DECREASE PICK FREQUENCY

**1. Efficient Markets**
- Prime time games (Sunday Night Football)
- Playoff games (too much sharp action)
- Popular teams (Lakers, Cowboys)

**2. Close Matchups**
- Teams with similar records
- Small spreads (-3 or less)
- Even ELO ratings

**3. Unpredictability**
- Rivalry games (emotion factor)
- Early season (limited data)
- New coaches/systems

**4. Model Disagreement**
- V5 picks one side, V6 picks other
- Wide variance in model probabilities
- Conflicting signals

## REALISTIC MONTHLY BREAKDOWN

### Conservative Estimate (Lower Bound):
- NBA: 30-40 picks/month (1-1.5 per day)
- NFL: 16-20 picks/month (4-5 per week)
- NHL: 25-35 picks/month (1 per day)
- Soccer: 8-12 picks/month (2-3 per week)
- **Total: 80-110 picks/month**

### Aggressive Estimate (Upper Bound):
- NBA: 60-75 picks/month (2-2.5 per day)
- NFL: 24-30 picks/month (6-8 per week)
- NHL: 40-50 picks/month (1.5 per day)
- Soccer: 12-18 picks/month (3-4 per week)
- **Total: 135-175 picks/month**

### Most Likely Scenario:
- **100-125 picks per month across all sports**
- **~4 picks per day average**
- **~25-30 picks per week**

### Quality Over Quantity:
- Algorithm is CONSERVATIVE by design
- Would rather skip 80% of games than force bad picks
- Focus on HIGH EDGE opportunities
- Target: 60%+ win rate, not high volume

## CONCLUSION

**Realistic Pick Frequency: 15-20% of all games analyzed**

This means:
- Out of 100 games checked, expect 15-20 picks
- Out of 10 NBA games tonight, expect 1-3 picks
- Out of 16 NFL games this week, expect 3-5 picks

**Why Conservative?**
1. Multiple thresholds must be met (60% confidence, 4% edge, model agreement)
2. V6 requires 3/5 models to agree with low variance
3. Both V5 and V6 independently conservative
4. Unified adds another layer of filtering

**This is GOOD for bankroll management!**
- Fewer picks = more selective
- Higher quality = better win rate
- Clear edge = positive ROI
- No forced bets on marginal games
